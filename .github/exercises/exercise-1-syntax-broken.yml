# EXERCISE 1: Syntax Errors (BROKEN)
# =============================================================================
# This workflow has several syntax errors that prevent it from running.
# Your task: Find and fix all the errors.
#
# HINTS:
# - Check indentation carefully (YAML requires consistent spacing)
# - Look for missing required fields
# - Check action names for typos
# - Verify YAML structure (colons, dashes, etc.)
#
# There are 5 errors in this file. Can you find them all?
